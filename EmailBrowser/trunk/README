
Introduction

  The EmailWebBrowser is an application that allows a user on a remote PC to
  request and then receive a web page through email.  The EmailWebBrowser allows a
  user on a Censored Network to access a website that she is normally blocked from
  viewing.  Censored networks can range from company intranets to a country's
  censored network.  The EmailWebBrowser application runs on Java 6.0.  The user
  can use any email client, however only the Opera Mail Client (minimum version
  9.27) supports all existing features.
